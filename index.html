        <p>Excessive rains since May have caused the worst flooding Bangladesh has seen in over two decades. Bangladesh has deployed its army to the impacted eastern areas of Sylhet, Sunamganj and Kurigram after water levels rose drastically, submerging houses and causing people to take shelter on roofs. On June 17th, 2022 all lines of communication in the region were destroyed, leaving nearly 500,000 people in 600 villages cut off from the rest of the country and stranded without any sources of food or drinking water.</p>
